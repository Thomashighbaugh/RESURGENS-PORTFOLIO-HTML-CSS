                                <p>HTML 5 and CSS 3 are used in conjunction with one another so thoroughly that it is not useful to separate them from one another in this context. This skill set
                                    is probably the only one I am more comfortable with than even Linux as it is one that I mastered since devoting myself completely to tech, which began about 2 years ago
                                    and has remained consistent ever since. While not terribly complex languages to learn, repetition and constant practice are necessary as the skill set itself is perishable if left unpracticed. </p>
                                    <p>The manner in which I keep my skill set with these languages sharp is through the constant tinkering with them I do on my portfolio site when otherwise not engaged in any professional activity
                                        requiring their use. This in conjunction with the use of both, to varying degrees, within JSX means that I am much more practiced in the use of HTML and CSS than practically any other skill set
                                        other than Linux and have ventured into many of the technologies surrounding them, such as cloud hosting, PHP, React, JS, etc. </p>
                                    <p>Further bolstering my knowledge of these languages was that they featured prominently in the cirriculm of the Front End Certificate I received in May of 2018. That course of studies took a
                                        significant dive into these tandem languages, JS, libraries of JS and APIs that helped to deepen my appreciation for the use of these languages in production environments and several recent
                                        classes on them specifically and web development in its broader application. While not requiring the sheer technical aptitude I have gained from JS and its frameworks, they speak to another skill
                                        set I bring with me, design and thus creative capacity of a more detailed, often analytical depth than imagining if pushing and popping elements out of an array will accomplish the task as
                                        there is little that is easily articulated in the creative pursuit but it requires imagining what would please a prospective user while not preventing that user from accomplishing the task that
                                        brought them to the site in the first place. While outside the scope of my character to release too many broken and buggy examples on VCS, especially because I administer my own cloud storage and
                                        thus can live without the OctoCat to store my code, the repository page has numerous examples of my deployment of these languages that upon completing my current dive into React, I plan to polish
                                        up more than their present state especially with comments indicating the precise functionality of the following code. A further testament to my use of these languages is this site, which I had coded using
                                        JetBrains WebStorm, my preferred text editor/IDE for using these languages. </p>

                                <p>Like other web development and design skills, my primary introduction to Javascript was during the course of study for the elsewhere mentioned Front End Certificate. Having had
                                some experience with scripting languages prior, specifically Python, I was able to easily apply those same paradigms to JS in its vanilla incarnation and several repos of unpolished
                                examples are available through GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket (see sidebar for links!) The underlying logic of Javascript I found to be somewhat more friendly to incorporate as it uses a terminal within the browser,
                                    which is part of what is enabling its application on client browsers. This coupled with the functionality of node modules makes for a language that while very amorphis in its form, is supremely easy to
                                    extend in any imaginable way, as the frameworks and libraries of recent fame demonstrate. </p>
                                <p>Below I will discuss most of the frameworks I have experience with individually, saving React for a separate modal.</p>
                                <p><em>Bootstrap:</em>Being a relatively small library with consistent results and easy application within a site, this library was one of the first I did any significant explanation
                                of, which was fortuitous as it still introduces concepts that become essential to understand in more complex frameworks. Bootstrap is especially useful in designing interfaces that mobile-friendly without as much tinkering as
                                is otherwise necessaary, however I have found I prefer to use the advanced HTML5 features to achieve the same effect as they enable more customization, which while being prone to bugs are also supremely capable in producing a dynamic interface that
                                has the design functionality I am looking for. Nonetheless, I can quickly and easily utilize the Bootstrap box model to produce interfaces that can then be rendered reliably across platforms and devices without having to
                                do too much additional testing, which is of course a boon in saving time. </p>\
                                <p><em>Vue:</em> Also introduced in my Front End Certificate studies, this library I have not had much use for but none the less was simple enough to tinker with that advanced functionality
                                may be introduced through it to existing pages without the need for a complete overhaul of the site in an incremental fashion. It is also scalable, something I explored when researching
                                    it on my own later own and found that while taking care of certain "snap in" needs easily and does so well, there are other ways to achieve similar effects that have a more natural flow within vanilla
                                Js and did not prioritize deepening my knowledge of it with React looming on the horizon of my self-learning journey. That admission being what it is, I can still easily pick up the framework and use it to
                                non-intrusively add dynamic functionality to a pre-built page quickly from both the ease of deployment it has baked in as well as my prior experience being such that the application logic merely needs to be
                                refreshed.</p>
