                                <p>HTML 5 and CSS 3 are used in conjunction with one another so thoroughly that it is not useful to separate them from one another in this context. This skill set
                                    is probably the only one I am more comfortable with than even Linux as it is one that I mastered since devoting myself completely to tech, which began about 2 years ago
                                    and has remained consistent ever since. While not terribly complex languages to learn, repetition and constant practice are necessary as the skill set itself is perishable if left unpracticed. </p>
                                    <p>The manner in which I keep my skill set with these languages sharp is through the constant tinkering with them I do on my portfolio site when otherwise not engaged in any professional activity
                                        requiring their use. This in conjunction with the use of both, to varying degrees, within JSX means that I am much more practiced in the use of HTML and CSS than practically any other skill set
                                        other than Linux and have ventured into many of the technologies surrounding them, such as cloud hosting, PHP, React, JS, etc. </p>
                                    <p>Further bolstering my knowledge of these languages was that they featured prominently in the cirriculm of the Front End Certificate I received in May of 2018. That course of studies took a
                                        significant dive into these tandem languages, JS, libraries of JS and APIs that helped to deepen my appreciation for the use of these languages in production environments and several recent
                                        classes on them specifically and web development in its broader application. While not requiring the sheer technical aptitude I have gained from JS and its frameworks, they speak to another skill
                                        set I bring with me, design and thus creative capacity of a more detailed, often analytical depth than imagining if pushing and popping elements out of an array will accomplish the task as
                                        there is little that is easily articulated in the creative pursuit but it requires imagining what would please a prospective user while not preventing that user from accomplishing the task that
                                        brought them to the site in the first place. While outside the scope of my character to release too many broken and buggy examples on VCS, especially because I administer my own cloud storage and
                                        thus can live without the OctoCat to store my code, the repository page has numerous examples of my deployment of these languages that upon completing my current dive into React, I plan to polish
                                        up more than their present state especially with comments indicating the precise functionality of the following code. A further testament to my use of these languages is this site, which I had coded using
                                        JetBrains WebStorm, my preferred text editor/IDE for using these languages. </p>

                                <p>Really most useful in the DevOps context, I have found Linux to be a perfectly functional and supremely rewarding OS to use a daily driver on all of my machines due to the power
                                the user has coupled with its relative security and the application of skills learned in other tasks and projects. Personally I do not see the need to run the heavy and unstable commercial
                                OSes on brand new hardware and in the case of Windows, modify that OS heavily for command line functionality when I can instead run a free OS that uses the BASH shell by default and in so doing
                                pick up DevOps and Sysad skills I can apply elsewhere. In my experience, these skills that any successful daily Linux usrer needs to maximize their Operating System compliment the experience
                                    and need for precicion that is inherent in any of the many forms software development requires mastery of to be successful in both learning and implementation.  </p>
                                <p>My use of Linux includes both desktop and server environments as I run several servers that provide services to other computers within that network such as Nextcloud and NFS
                                shares I use for redundant backup. One server I currently own and make constant use of essentially functions as a hypervisor for several virtual servers that I use for developing and
                                learning various, configuration frameworks and languages such as React, thus providing a consistent environment that can be effortlessly restored to its freshly provisioned state without
                                risk to the continued operation of the above mentioned microservices.</p>
                                <p>As is easily anticipated, the servers are accessed through SSH within the internal network and can be accessed externally through a Digital Ocean server provisioned to function as a VPN gateway
                                in the traditional meaning of the acronym. These machines are accessed through other Linux machines, specifically PopOS which I use on my workstation and laptop because of its low system overhead
                                while retaining the functionality of Ubuntu. My workstation is general purpose and I use it for a lot of addtional applications, such as photo-editing, developing with IDEs, multimedia, etc but rarely
                                experiences much of the productivity sapping stalling that regardless of the machine, seems inevitable with the commercial alternatives. </p>
                                <p> The depth of my Linux experience is certainly the deepest of any other skill at this point due to length of time I have used it almost exclusively (as I need Windows VMs to test websites on) and
                                    ranges from shell scripts to using SSH to provision and spin up virtual environments using virtualbox's well developed cli tool set for purposes of development. See the repository for some of my shell scripts
                                and for more of my adventures in Linux check out my blog, I am in the process of writing up a comprehensive set of tips and tricks for new users to avoid common pitfalls that have sent some back to
                                    commercial alternatives that you might want to check out. Being that Linux and macOS share lineage from Unix, these skills also translate very easily to macOS and have enabled me to repair macOS systems without
                                any excessive levels of befuddlement. </p>

                            <div class="modal-body">
                                <p>Like other web development and design skills, my primary introduction to Javascript was during the course of study for the elsewhere mentioned Front End Certificate. Having had
                                some experience with scripting languages prior, specifically Python, I was able to easily apply those same paradigms to JS in its vanilla incarnation and several repos of unpolished
                                examples are available through GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket (see sidebar for links!) The underlying logic of Javascript I found to be somewhat more friendly to incorporate as it uses a terminal within the browser,
                                    which is part of what is enabling its application on client browsers. This coupled with the functionality of node modules makes for a language that while very amorphis in its form, is supremely easy to
                                    extend in any imaginable way, as the frameworks and libraries of recent fame demonstrate. </p>
                                <p>Below I will discuss most of the frameworks I have experience with individually, saving React for a separate modal.</p>
                                <p><em>Bootstrap:</em>Being a relatively small library with consistent results and easy application within a site, this library was one of the first I did any significant explanation
                                of, which was fortuitous as it still introduces concepts that become essential to understand in more complex frameworks. Bootstrap is especially useful in designing interfaces that mobile-friendly without as much tinkering as
                                is otherwise necessaary, however I have found I prefer to use the advanced HTML5 features to achieve the same effect as they enable more customization, which while being prone to bugs are also supremely capable in producing a dynamic interface that
                                has the design functionality I am looking for. Nonetheless, I can quickly and easily utilize the Bootstrap box model to produce interfaces that can then be rendered reliably across platforms and devices without having to
                                do too much additional testing, which is of course a boon in saving time. </p>\
                                <p><em>Vue:</em> Also introduced in my Front End Certificate studies, this library I have not had much use for but none the less was simple enough to tinker with that advanced functionality
                                may be introduced through it to existing pages without the need for a complete overhaul of the site in an incremental fashion. It is also scalable, something I explored when researching
                                    it on my own later own and found that while taking care of certain "snap in" needs easily and does so well, there are other ways to achieve similar effects that have a more natural flow within vanilla
                                Js and did not prioritize deepening my knowledge of it with React looming on the horizon of my self-learning journey. That admission being what it is, I can still easily pick up the framework and use it to
                                non-intrusively add dynamic functionality to a pre-built page quickly from both the ease of deployment it has baked in as well as my prior experience being such that the application logic merely needs to be
                                refreshed.</p>

                                <p>This framework was separated from other JS frameworks because of its primacy in importance and because of nesting in other technologies I learned
                                    before pursuing it. While an advocate of using CodeSandbox.io for developing consistently in React, I personally was not satisfied with such an arrangement and subsequently pursued several VM and Container
                                options before settling on my current arrangement in which I spin up Lubuntu environments from snapshots which have create-react-app, the babel transpiler, a blank directory with a package.json calling for local installation of React and ReactDOM a configured WebStorm, a consistent NPM and Node pulled from NXM and custom ICE web-containers
                                leading to the documentation for Babel, React's documentation and CodeSandbox.io to back up the code I am not done tinkering with and do not want to release to the public yet. </p>
                                <p>While still in the process of learning React, having put a counter and decision engine app on GitHub fully polished, though admittedly ugly, I can see what the use of the React Framework truly is for improving the way
                                that the DOM, thus potential user, is better accounted for by the developer as the developer employs it to not only provide application logic to the page but to create the whole page, meaning that the application logic and the
                                design at least have to both be known, if not designed by the developer. Which brings me to the language coupled to React, JSX, which itself is extensible HTML within a JS file, connecting back to HTML through a root element. In order
                                to fully appreciate what that means, one first must have experience with HTML both its contemporary usage as well as XHTML, which had no semantic prohibition in convention of the useful but meaningless div tag, of which my anchors tend to be.
                                By composing the JS and HTML within the same file, and using NPM the potential exists to include CSS as well, I have found that imaging how the application logic and form of the site work together to achieve interactivity in a non-trivial way.
                                This is something I continue to learn, so look to GitHub for examples of my rapidly expanding knowledge as evidenced in code. </p>
